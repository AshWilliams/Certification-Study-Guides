# Certification Study Guides #

## A Shared Resource ##

I have compiled my study guide work here to help myself and others in covering any freely available material pertaining to the certifications encapsulated here.
This is not a completely exhaustive list of resource material but will, hopefully, provide some perspective and enough coverage of material for a student to gauge their readiness for a certification test.
